This is to create blocks in the genome based on an r-squared value measured between genotypes. The smaller the r-squared, the higher the possibility of the genotypes belonging in the same block. Here is a plot that shows how the average r-squared between blacks and whites decays with the number of markers spearting the two markers at which the correclation is being calculated.
